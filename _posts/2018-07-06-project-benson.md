## Benson Project

### Introduction
The first day of Metis off to a good start and by the end of the day Benson was introduced. As the heading suggests the project name was Benson! Why the name Benson? I will get back to you on this. We were all divided in groups of 4 and as a
team by the end of week do a presentation on the data analysis findings. The problem statement was with the help of MTA data, recommend subway stations for the street team to solicit for WTWY Gala and create awareness in New York. The street team have to reach out people who can attend gala and donate for the cause.

### Approach
We started brainstorming and came up with various ideas how to approach this problem. After considering different additional data sources like Yelp, Google maps API we finalized to add data from census (ACS) and mapped their location with Google maps API. The census data has various data points to consider like the house hold income, demographic, location near to MTA stations. The MTA turnstile data are available weekly wise for the subway stations. The WTWY organize annual Gala in the beginning of summer. To analyze the MTA turnstile data for 2018 we have decided to take 
The median income of New Yorkers who are likely to attend the WTWY Gala and contribute is 150K to 200K according to our assumption. The income brackets with more than 200K are less likely to use MTA subway stations and the income with less than 150K are less likely to attend the Gala. Our aim is to maximize the audience for this Gala where the MTA stations are located with the target population.
